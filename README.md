The code is a result of my own efforts learning about CV techniques through varioues media (video, articles, code, books), looking at other people's code, using and modifying it, as well as writing my own code. I have explored multiple techniques in each file to reduce the number of files and make it easier to observe the results. Each sub-folder contains a .cpp file with code and a .jpg/.png with the code output. Each file is complete (does what it is expected to), but sub-optimal (code could be improved in terms of performance).
